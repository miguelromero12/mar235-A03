Tutorial Steps 
Download Webstorm and Github account.

1.The first thing is to download an environment for your programing there are different places, but the best one is JetBrains 
they have an application call webstorm that is an environment application.

3. Name your file and project as a simple in lowercase letters are recommended.

Creating and storage the file in Git and a repository in GitHub.

1.After you created your HTML file, you need to storage your code in a Git by creating a repository 
you would need to go to VCS in the option of import into version control you would need to share your document in git.

2.After doing this you are going to be able to storage any progress in your local computer. You can save such things by using the commit bottom in the same VCS place.

3.This brings us to upload your code in into GitHub in the same VCS section on top of your webstorm you go to go where it says import version control and how is the first time 
you need to go and share your project to GitHub after that is going to bring you to create a repository in your GitHub account.
Make sure you upload and name your repository in lowercase recommend it.

You can also create files in GitHub such as README files that are used to give instruction to different programmers that are looking at your code.
